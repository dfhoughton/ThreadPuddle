/**

 * what it adds to an ordinary {@link ExecutorService} is {@link #flush()},
 * which you can call after you've submitted all the tasks to run concurrently;
 * it will block until all processes have completed. Also, its task queue is
 * necessarily limited, so it will block if the thread generating work runs too
 * far ahead of the threads doing it.
 * <p>
 * All of a puddle's threads are daemons. If a task given to the puddle throws
 * an error, the errors stack trace will be printed. If you wish different error
 * handling, you must include this in the task itself.
